App description:

This is a Studio Ghibli Movie App. My app is a single page application (SPA). My frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It accesses data from a db.json file using json server. My app shows a list of 5 well known movies produced by Studio Ghibli. When a user clicks on a movie title, the app will show more information about the movie that was clicked. When the user's mouse leaves the movie button, the app will show the list of movies again. When the user mouses over the dark/light mode button, the app will change to dark/light mode.
